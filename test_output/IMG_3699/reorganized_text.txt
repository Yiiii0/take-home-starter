**FUTURE MEDICAL CARE INDICATED**

At the time of my evaluation on December 19, 2024, Mr. Grende's complaints have surpassed the evidence-based literary standards regarding chronic injury and chronic pain. Therefore, all future medical considerations for these injuries are applicable to the California Code of Regulations, ยง 9792.20 - ยง 9792.26: Chronic Pain Medical Treatment Guidelines, and whether said treatments are administered in compliance with the Chronic Medical Treatment Utilization Schedule.

A protective further medical award is required in this case. Limited supportive medical treatment, under the guidance of a treating medical physician, is recommended and must be consistent with evidence-based medicine. Ongoing use of medications, including anti-inflammatory agents, muscle relaxants, neuromodulators, and potentially, narcotic analgesics, should be administered through a medical physician skilled in chronic pain management, which seems to be ongoing through Boomerang Healthcare. This approach is both reasonable and necessary.

Acupuncture for chronic pain management is medically reasonable and non-invasive, thus unlikely to harm any underlying pathology that is yet to be determined from the necessary diagnostics. 

With respect to corticosteroid injections (CSI) and/or platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections at the left and/or right wrist, left and/or right elbow, or shoulder, these would be administered consistent with evidence-based medicine (EBM) standards of care guidelines. A side provision for such is deemed appropriate and should be determined by an orthopedic wrist/shoulder surgeon and/or a chronic pain management specialist. 

Spinal injection protocols would similarly follow EBM guidelines. It is medically necessary, on a medical-legal basis, to proceed with lumbar spine plain X-rays as a starting point to determine if suspected underlying skeletal pathologies exist, which would then be viewed in the context of contributing to low back pain (LBP) and lend themselves to consideration of apportioned pathologies.

The following are necessary and applicable to AMA Guides principles as noted in Chapter 15, Subsection 15.1, on pages 378 to 379 regarding motion segment integrity: Weight-bearing AP Lateral, Flexion/Extension, R/L Oblique, and Caudal. Be it known that spinal manipulation at/over C3 to 4-5 to 6 is strongly contraindicated. Impulses, however, are reasonable at these levels, and chiropractic treatments would follow EBM.

Finally, a provision should be set aside to allow for revision left shoulder re-surgery should symptoms worsen and become increasingly debilitating. This should be determined by an orthopedic shoulder surgeon. It is critical that the compensatory right shoulder pain, where unresponsive to conservative care, ultimately requires further evaluation.
