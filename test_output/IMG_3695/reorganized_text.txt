**CAUSAL ANALYSIS**

Bearing in mind the Bradford Hill Criteria and the aspects of association, as well as the standard of reasonable medical probability, the following scenarios are the most plausible explanations of the symptom development associated with the alleged mechanism of injury, as related to me by Ms. Grande. 

**Side Note:** Given my 31 years as a State Qualified Medical Evaluator and having served the Department of Industrial Relations from 1993 to 1994 as a Subject Matter Expert, chairing the panel in Northern California that determined compensability, I have 7 years of specialty experience upon which to make a causative analysis that complies with reasonable medical probability based on substantial medical evidence.

**Strength of Association:** According to literature, long associations are certainly more likely to be viewed as causal than those which are weak. However, a small association does not mean that there is no causal effect; the larger the association, the more likely it is causal in nature. Viewing this injured worker as a credible historian, and where records have been reviewed that would lead a reasonable medical-legal evaluator to a different conclusory finding, the history as depicted favors a specific acute, macrotraumatic mechanical injury of February 9, 2021, causing what appears to be a rotator cuff injury to the left shoulder, arising from and occurring during his usual and customary employment at Alton Management Corporation while awkwardly manipulating a lawnmower. Thus, the strength of associated factors is in substantial conformity with AOE (Arising Out of Employment).

**COE Doctrine:** Regarding the filing for cumulative injuries arising out of said employment, it is important to remind both parties and inform the Trier of Fact that a Job Description has been provided for this injured worker, although it is referred to in the Defendant's Cover Letter as a Groundskeeper. 

As I thoroughly reviewed the PTP POR 2 report from Dr. Khoung, particularly the memo and socialized imaging, I note that over the 424 years I have served the public, I have amassed 7,000 individual patient files between 1983 and 2008. The injured worker has denied having such notable degenerative pathologies in the regions now claimed as being injured cumulatively. I assert that, absent records to the contrary, the strength of association reasonably favors such through the arduous nature of his work spanning April 1, 1998, through February 9, 2021.

**Consistency:** This concept indicates that the same answers could be achieved in a variety of different situations, both prospectively and retrospectively, and within different populations. Mr. Grande presents with a stated history pertaining to February 9, 2021, which is consistent with a macrotraumatic left shoulder injury, and no evidence to the contrary has been reviewed. 

Regarding cumulative injury complaints, absent a history of external physical trauma, genetic illnesses/pathologies, or some acquired disease process, his claims for cumulative neck, both shoulders, both wrists, mid-back, and lower back are consistent with repetitive arduous physical labor, resulting in wear and tear on the soft tissues and articulations, day by day, year after year.
