**CAUSAL ANALYSIS**  

Bearing in mind the Bradford Hill Criteria and the aspects of association, as well as the standard of reasonable medical probability, the following scenarios are the most plausible explanations of the symptom development associated with the alleged mechanism of injury, as related to me by Ms. Grande. 

**Side Note:** Given my 31 years as a State Qualified Medical Evaluator and having served the Department of Industrial Relations from 1993 to 1994 as a Subject Matter Expert, chairing the panel in Northern California that determined compensability, I have a 7-year specialty upon which to make a causative analysis. This analysis complies with reasonable medical probability based on substantial medical evidence. 

**Strength of Association:** According to literature, long associations are certainly more likely to be viewed as causal than those which are weak. However, a small association does not mean that there is no causal effect; the larger the association, the more likely it is causal in nature. Viewing this injured worker as a credible historian, and where no records have been reviewed that would lead a reasonable medical-legal evaluator to a different conclusory finding, the history as depicted favors a specific acute, macrotraumatic, mechanical injury of February 9, 2021, causing what appears to be a rotator cuff injury to the left shoulder. This injury arose from and occurred during his usual and customary employment at Alton Management Corporation while awkwardly manipulating a lawnmower. Thus, the strength of associated factors is in substantial conformity with the AOE (Arising Out of Employment) doctrine.

Regarding the filing for cumulative injuries arising out of said employment, it is important to remind both parties and inform the Trier of Fact that a Job Description has been provided for this injured worker, although it is referred to in the Defendant's Cover Letter as a Groundskeeper. 

I thoroughly reviewed the PTP (Primary Treating Physician) report from Dr. Khoung, particularly the memorialized imaging. Over the course of my 424 years of service to the public, I have amassed 7,000 individual patient files between 1983 and 2008. It is notable that the injured worker has denied having such significant degenerative pathologies in the regions now claimed as being injured cumulatively. I assert that absent records to the contrary, the strength of association reasonably favors such pathologies through the arduous nature of his work spanning from April 1, 1998, through February 9, 2021.

**Consistency:** This concept indicates that the same answers could be achieved in a variety of different situations, both prospectively and retrospectively, and within different populations. Mr. Grande presents with a stated history pertaining to February 9, 2021, which is consistent with a macrotraumatic left shoulder injury, and no evidence to the contrary has been reviewed. 

Regarding cumulative injury complaints, absent a history of external physical trauma, genetic illnesses/pathologies, or some acquired disease process, his claims for cumulative neck, both shoulders, both wrists, mid-back, and lower back are consistent with repetitive arduous physical labor, resulting in wear and tear on the soft tissues and articulations, day by day, year after year.
