**Specificity**: This concept identifies that exposure may give rise to an outcome regarding musculoskeletal injury. The relationship is equivocal to the concept that the greater the probability of exposure, the greater the likelihood of an associated outcome. Unfortunately, no records were considered relevant for my review, other than those noted herein. As such, I cannot offer any intelligent, cogent argument supporting any underlying condition that predisposed this injured worker to the complaints shown in the reports. 

The injured worker denies pre-existing injuries to the body parts identified herein, and where no evidence to the contrary exists, his susceptibility to these injuries and the extent to which they were evidentially determined cannot be addressed to the standard of reasonable medical probability without the opportunity to review the entire medical records accumulated through the specified time frame of January 01, 2000, through the date of the specific injury on February 09, 2021, the latter alleged to be the last day that work was performed.

**Temporality**: This concept suggests that it is an absolutely necessary criterion for causal associations between exposure and an outcome. Temporality is a known concept related to time. The temporal onset of traumatic injuries involving the left shoulder girdle appears to have been immediate, thus supporting a cumulative musculoskeletal injury. It is more likely than not that these injuries were not superimposed upon pre-existing, varying degrees of tissue degeneration at the left shoulder girdle. By strict application of medical terminology, this represents an "aggravation" injury, viewed in the context of reasonable medical probability.

The temporal onset of cumulative and repetitive microtraumatic injuries must be addressed, using the standard of reasonable medical probability. This can only be achieved by the opportunity to review the entire medical records spanning the January threshold, which is predictably a non-linear association to the greater the likelihood of incidence of the effect. 

The dose-response for the alleged cumulative trauma injuries reasonably spans the course of the injured worker's employment at Alion Management Corporation, as this injured worker denies pre-existing injuries or complaints that required medical attention in the body regions now claimed: neck, both shoulders, both wrists, mid-back, and left shoulder girdle.

**Biological Plausibility**: In the field of epidemiology and biomedicine, biological plausibility is the proposal of causal association that is consistent with existing laws and medical criteria. Yet, biological plausibility is just one component of a method of reasoning. Based on my review of the circumstances, the lifting upward of the handle of the lawnmower and awkwardly pivoting to the right with the right arm may have contributed to the injuries sustained.
