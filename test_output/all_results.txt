Question: What is the diagnosis?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The diagnosis is a rotator cuff injury to the left shoulder.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question: What is the causation?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The causation identified in the context is a specific acute, macrotraumatic mechanical injury of February 9, 2021, causing what appears to be a rotator cuff injury to the left shoulder. This injury arose from and occurred during the injured worker's usual and customary employment at Alton Management Corporation while awkwardly manipulating a lawnmower. Additionally, the claims for cumulative injuries to the neck, both shoulders, both wrists, mid-back, and lower back are consistent with repetitive arduous physical labor, resulting in wear and tear on the soft tissues and articulations over the span of the worker's employment from April 1, 1998, through February 9, 2021.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Information not found in the provided context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question: What is the causation?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The causation suggested in the context is that the lifting upward of the handle of the lawnmower and awkwardly pivoting to the right with the right arm may have contributed to the injuries sustained. Additionally, the temporal onset of traumatic injuries involving the left shoulder girdle appears to have been immediate, supporting a cumulative musculoskeletal injury, which is viewed as an "aggravation" injury in the context of reasonable medical probability.

4. **Spinal injection protocols** that would follow evidence-based medicine guidelines.
5. **Lumbar spine plain X-rays** to determine if suspected underlying skeletal pathologies exist.
6. **Revision left shoulder re-surgery** should symptoms worsen and become increasingly debilitating, determined by an orthopedic shoulder surgeon.
