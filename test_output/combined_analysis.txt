3. Acupuncture for chronic pain management, deemed medically reasonable and non-invasive.
4. Corticosteroid injections (CSI) and/or platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections at the left and/or right wrist, left and/or right elbow, or shoulder, administered consistent with evidence-based medicine (EBM) standards of care guidelines.
5. Spinal injection protocols following EBM guidelines.
6. Lumbar spine plain X-rays to determine suspected underlying skeletal pathologies contributing to low back pain (LBP).
7. Chiropractic treatments following EBM, with spinal manipulation at/over C3 to 4-5 to 6 being strongly contraindicated, but impulses being reasonable at these levels.
8. A provision for revision left shoulder re-surgery should symptoms worsen and become increasingly debilitating, determined by an orthopedic shoulder surgeon. 

Additionally, further evaluation for compensatory right shoulder pain, unresponsive to conservative care, is also recommended.

Document IMG_3699:
Yes, there are medical restrictions suggested in the context. Specifically, it is stated that "spinal manipulation at/over C3 to 4-5 to 6 is strongly contraindicated." This indicates a restriction on performing spinal manipulation in that specific cervical region. Additionally, the context implies that further evaluation and potential surgical intervention for the right shoulder pain may be necessary if conservative care is unresponsive, suggesting a cautious approach to treatment until further assessments are made.

Question: What is the causation?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Individual Document Answers:

Document IMG_3695:
The causation identified in the document is that the injured worker sustained a specific acute, macrotraumatic, mechanical injury to the left shoulder on February 9, 2021, while awkwardly manipulating a lawnmower during his usual and customary employment at Alton Management Corporation. This injury is associated with the Arising Out of Employment (AOE) doctrine. Additionally, the document suggests that cumulative injuries to the neck, both shoulders, both wrists, mid-back, and lower back are consistent with repetitive arduous physical labor over the course of his employment from April 1, 1998, through February 9, 2021, resulting in wear and tear on the soft tissues and articulations.

Document IMG_3696:
The causation suggested in the context is that the lifting upward of the handle of the lawnmower and awkwardly pivoting to the right may have contributed to the injuries sustained by the injured worker. Additionally, it is noted that the temporal onset of traumatic injuries involving the left shoulder girdle appears to have been immediate, supporting the notion of acute musculoskeletal injury, and it is more likely than not that these injuries were not superimposed upon pre-existing tissue degeneration at the left shoulder girdle, representing an "aggravation" injury.

Document IMG_3697:
The causation is that the nature of Mr. Grande's employment with Alton Management Corporation caused and contributed to the specific injury as known, as well as caused and contributed to the injuries to his neck, upper back, shoulders, gluteal area, and supporting tissues, as well as both wrists, forearms, and elbows.

**Synthesized Answer:**

The causation identified across the documents indicates that the injured worker sustained a specific acute, macrotraumatic, mechanical injury to the left shoulder on February 9, 2021, while awkwardly manipulating a lawnmower during his employment at Alton Management Corporation. This incident is associated with the Arising Out of Employment (AOE) doctrine. The act of lifting upward on the handle of the lawnmower and awkwardly pivoting to the right is suggested to have contributed to these injuries. The temporal onset of the traumatic injuries to the left shoulder girdle was immediate, supporting the notion of an acute musculoskeletal injury. It is noted that these injuries were likely not superimposed upon pre-existing tissue degeneration, indicating they represent an "aggravation" injury.

Additionally, the nature of the worker's employment contributed to cumulative injuries affecting the neck, both shoulders, both wrists, mid-back, lower back, upper back, gluteal area, and supporting tissues, as well as both forearms and elbows, consistent with repetitive arduous physical labor performed from April 1, 1998, through February 9, 2021, resulting in wear and tear on the soft tissues and articulations.

**Conflicts or Discrepancies:**
There are no significant conflicts or discrepancies between the documents. All documents consistently indicate that the injuries are related to the worker's employment and the specific incident involving the lawnmower.
