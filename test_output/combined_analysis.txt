3. **Corticosteroid injections (CSI) and/or platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections** at the left and/or right wrist, left and/or right elbow, or shoulder, to be administered consistent with evidence-based medicine standards.
4. **Spinal injection protocols** that would follow evidence-based medicine guidelines.
5. **Lumbar spine plain X-rays** to determine if suspected underlying skeletal pathologies exist.

Question: What is the causation?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Individual Document Answers:

Document IMG_3695:
The causation identified in the context is a specific acute, macrotraumatic mechanical injury of February 9, 2021, causing what appears to be a rotator cuff injury to the left shoulder. This injury arose from and occurred during the injured worker's usual and customary employment at Alton Management Corporation while awkwardly manipulating a lawnmower. Additionally, the claims for cumulative injuries to the neck, both shoulders, both wrists, mid-back, and lower back are consistent with repetitive arduous physical labor, resulting in wear and tear on the soft tissues and articulations over the span of the worker's employment from April 1, 1998, through February 9, 2021.

Document IMG_3696:
The causation suggested in the context is that the lifting upward of the handle of the lawnmower and awkwardly pivoting to the right with the right arm may have contributed to the injuries sustained. Additionally, the temporal onset of traumatic injuries involving the left shoulder girdle appears to have been immediate, supporting a cumulative musculoskeletal injury, which is viewed as an "aggravation" injury in the context of reasonable medical probability.

Document IMG_3697:
The causation is that the nature of Mr. Grande's employment with Alton Management Corporation caused and contributed to the specific injury as known, as well as caused and contributed to the injuries to his neck, upper back, shoulders, gluteal area, and supporting tissues, as well as both wrists, forearms, and elbows.

Synthesized Answer:
**Synthesized Answer:**

The causation identified across the documents relates to a specific acute, macrotraumatic mechanical injury that occurred on February 9, 2021, resulting in a rotator cuff injury to the left shoulder. This injury arose during the injured worker's employment at Alton Management Corporation while awkwardly manipulating a lawnmower. Additionally, there are claims of cumulative injuries affecting the neck, both shoulders, both wrists, mid-back, and lower back, attributed to the repetitive arduous physical labor performed by the worker from April 1, 1998, through February 9, 2021. The act of lifting the lawnmower's handle and awkwardly pivoting to the right with the right arm is suggested to have contributed to these injuries, with the onset of the left shoulder injuries being immediate and indicative of a cumulative musculoskeletal injury, viewed as an "aggravation" injury in reasonable medical probability.

**Conflicts or Discrepancies:**
There are no significant conflicts or discrepancies between the documents. All documents consistently attribute the causation of injuries to the nature of the worker's employment and the specific actions taken while manipulating the lawnmower.
