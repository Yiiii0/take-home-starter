This injury is associated with the Arising Out of Employment (AOE) doctrine. Additionally, the document suggests that cumulative injuries to the neck, both shoulders, both wrists, mid-back, and lower back are consistent with repetitive arduous physical labor over the course of his employment from April 1, 1998, through February 9, 2021, resulting in wear and tear on the soft tissues and articulations."

        "answer": "The causation suggested in the context is that the lifting upward of the handle of the lawnmower and awkwardly pivoting to the right may have contributed to the injuries sustained by the injured worker. Additionally, it is noted that the temporal onset of traumatic injuries involving the left shoulder girdle appears to have been immediate, supporting the notion of acute musculoskeletal injury, and it is more likely than not that these injuries were not superimposed upon pre-existing tissue degeneration at the left shoulder girdle, representing an \"aggravation\" injury."

Acupuncture for chronic pain management, deemed medically reasonable and non-invasive.\n4. Corticosteroid injections (CSI) and/or platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections at the left and/or right wrist, left and/or right elbow, or shoulder, administered consistent with evidence-based medicine (EBM) standards of care guidelines.\n5. Spinal injection protocols following EBM guidelines.\n6. Lumbar spine plain X-rays to determine suspected underlying skeletal pathologies contributing to low back pain (LBP).\n7. Chiropractic treatments following EBM, with spinal manipulation at/over C3 to 4-5 to 6 being strongly contraindicated, but impulses being reasonable at these levels.\n8. A provision for revision left shoulder re-surgery should symptoms worsen and become increasingly debilitating, determined by an orthopedic shoulder surgeon. \n\nAdditionally, further evaluation for compensatory right shoulder pain, unresponsive to conservative care, is also recommended."

        "answer": "Yes, there are medical restrictions suggested in the context. Specifically, it is stated that \"spinal manipulation at/over C3 to 4-5 to 6 is strongly contraindicated.\" This indicates a restriction on performing spinal manipulation in that specific cervical region. Additionally, the context implies that further evaluation and potential surgical intervention for the right shoulder pain may be necessary if conservative care is unresponsive, suggesting a cautious approach to treatment until further assessments are made."
