        "answer": "The causation identified in the context is a specific acute, macrotraumatic mechanical injury of February 9, 2021, causing what appears to be a rotator cuff injury to the left shoulder. This injury arose from and occurred during the injured worker's usual and customary employment at Alton Management Corporation while awkwardly manipulating a lawnmower. Additionally, the claims for cumulative injuries to the neck, both shoulders, both wrists, mid-back, and lower back are consistent with repetitive arduous physical labor, resulting in wear and tear on the soft tissues and articulations over the span of the worker's employment from April 1, 1998, through February 9, 2021."

Additionally, the temporal onset of traumatic injuries involving the left shoulder girdle appears to have been immediate, supporting a cumulative musculoskeletal injury, which is viewed as an \"aggravation\" injury in the context of reasonable medical probability."
