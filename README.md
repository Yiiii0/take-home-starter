### Approach to Text Cleaning and LLM Integration

Our approach to building this medical-legal document processing pipeline was driven by the unique challenges faced by healthcare startups. The medical-legal domain requires extremely high accuracy while dealing with sensitive information, so we prioritized reliability and precision over processing speed.

The text cleaning pipeline employs a domain-specific approach that preserves the critical medical and legal terminology that often gets corrupted in standard OCR cleaning processes. Rather than using generic text cleaning rules, we implemented a conservative strategy that maintains document integrity while focusing on medical terminology preservation. This includes:
- Custom regex patterns for medical terms, diagnoses, and procedural codes
- Intelligent line break handling that preserves report structure
- Extraction of key medical dates, codes, and measurements
- Special handling of medical abbreviations and symbols
- Preservation of document hierarchical structure (sections, subsections)

For LLM integration, we developed a context-aware approach that mirrors how medical professionals read and interpret these documents. The system first reorganizes the text to follow a standard medical report structure, which significantly improves the accuracy of LLM responses. Key features include:
- Medical context preservation through intelligent text chunking
- Cross-reference handling between different sections of the report
- Confidence scoring based on medical terminology presence
- Multi-document synthesis for comprehensive patient history
- Explicit uncertainty handling for ambiguous medical information

### Assumptions and Trade-offs

1. OCR Quality vs. Speed:
   - Prioritized accuracy over processing speed, crucial for medical-legal compliance
   - Implemented multiple OCR passes with medical-specific configurations
   - Trade-off: Higher processing costs but reduced risk of medical errors

2. Memory Management:
   - Designed for scalability with large medical record sets
   - Implemented secure batch processing with encryption at rest
   - Trade-off: Increased storage costs for better HIPAA compliance

3. Answer Accuracy:
   - Implemented strict confidence thresholds for medical information
   - Added cross-validation against known medical terminology
   - Trade-off: More "requires human review" responses but higher reliability

4. Text Reorganization:
   - Built medical-document-aware reorganization
   - Preserves critical healthcare workflow structure
   - Trade-off: Additional processing time for better context understanding

5. Data Privacy:
   - Implemented strict data handling protocols
   - Limited data retention and secure processing
   - Trade-off: Some features restricted for privacy compliance

### Future Improvements

1. Performance Optimization:
   - Implement parallel processing for OCR and LLM like async implementations
   - Add specialized medical GPU acceleration
   - Optimize for real-time emergency room usage

2. Enhanced Medical Document Support:
   - Add support for handwritten doctor's notes
   - Implement medical image analysis integration
   - Add support for various medical document formats (FHIR, HL7)

3. LLM Enhancements:
   - Implement medical knowledge validation
   - Add support for medical coding automation
   - Improve handling of medical contradictions

4. Clinical Integration:
   - Build EMR/EHR system integrations
   - Add support for real-time clinical decision support
   - Implement medical workflow automation

5. Compliance and Quality:
   - Add HIPAA compliance automation
   - Implement medical audit trails
   - Add support for peer review workflows

6. Business Scaling:
   - Implement multi-tenant architecture
   - Add white-label capabilities
   - Build analytics for ROI tracking

7. Market Expansion:
   - Add support for insurance claim processing
   - Implement legal compliance checking
   - Add medical billing integration



# OCR-LLM Pipeline Implementation

## Project Overview
This project implements a pipeline that processes medical-legal documents through OCR and uses LLM to answer questions about their content. 
The pipeline successfully handles both single documents and batches of documents, with built-in support for large files and error recovery.
Supported simple RAG functionality.

## Implementation Process

### 1. Document Management System
- Implemented `DocumentStore` class for efficient document handling
- Supports both single files and directories of PDFs
- Maintains document metadata and processing history
- Implements caching to avoid reprocessing documents

### 2. OCR Implementation
- Primary OCR engine: Tesseract with optimized settings
- Fallback to EasyOCR for difficult pages
- Multi-attempt OCR with different settings for low-confidence results
- Batch processing for large documents (50 pages per batch)
- Confidence tracking and quality assurance

### 3. Text Cleaning Pipeline
- Regex-based noise removal
- Medical terminology preservation
- Structural information extraction
- Line break normalization
- Special character handling
- Domain-specific corrections

### 4. LLM Integration
- OpenAI GPT-4o-mini integration with context management
- Text reorganization for better context understanding
- Chunked processing for large documents
- Cross-document analysis for multiple files
- Confidence-based answer validation

### 5. Output Organization
- Structured JSON outputs
- Human-readable text summaries
- Detailed processing logs
- Cross-document analysis reports
- Failed pages and retry reports
